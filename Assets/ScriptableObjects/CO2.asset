  descriptionText: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound made up of two oxygen
    atoms bonded to a single carbon atom. It is a gas at room temperature and is
    colorless, odorless, and tasteless. CO2 is present in the Earth's atmosphere
    at low concentrations, but it is an important greenhouse gas that helps regulate
    the Earth's temperature. It is also a byproduct of the metabolic processes of
    animals and the burning of fossil fuels.
