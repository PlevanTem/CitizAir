# CitizAir
KTH DM2799 Advanced media project course

This study explores how augmented reality (AR) affects engagement and learning about air quality in a mobile application. It is a pilot study for CitizAir, a project that aims to visualize air quality in Stockholm in an engaging way, so as to educate and empower citizens to participate in debates about causes of pollution and actions to reduce it. We use co-creative methods to design a high fidelity prototype and qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods to compare this with an existing solution.
